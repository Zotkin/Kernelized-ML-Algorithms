# Kernel-Methods
Kernelized versions of classic machine learning algorithms.

The following algorithms are implemented:

- Kernel PCA
- Kernel K-Means
- Kernelized Logistic Regression
- Kernelized Support Vector Data Descriptor

All the implementation work with `rbf`, `polynomial` and `linear` kernels.
The implementation interface follows the Scikit-Learn API.
